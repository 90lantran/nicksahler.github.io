Hi! I'm Nick. I was born in 1994 and I’m presently 20 years old. I’m from New Jersey, from a tiny town right next to Princeton. This is what I look like:

*I am a reductionist utilitarian autodidact to the effect of minimalism.*  
This means that I am relatively materialistic, but like to keep it to a minimum, love Ockham’s razor, hate waste, and am primarily self taught.

*I am intrinsically motivated.*  
This means that I am not motivated purely by traditional, extrinsic reward (money, status, etc); instead, I am motivated by autonomy, mastery and purpose. That said; I still like money. I am just not *entirely* motivated to do complex things and things I am passionate about, by money.

I’m currently working on:

- **Macrocosm, an augmented RPG**. I’ve been working on it on and off for ~ a year. It’s written in NodeJS using nginx for serving/routing and mongodb for storage. It was originally entirely in Google’s App engine (Java); But I decided that I wanted to go independent with it, and be able to host it on whatever. I’ll post a lot more info soon.
