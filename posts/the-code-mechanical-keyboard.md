I just got my [CODE](http://codekeyboards.com) in the post today! What's a CODE, you ask? CODE is a keyboard that aims to be simple, clean, and beautiful. It was designed as a collaborative project between [WASD Keyboards](wasdkeyboards.com)' Weyman Kwong and Jeff "[codinghorror](http://twitter.com/codinghorror)" Atwood.

I've been anticipating buying one for a while, but missed my chance to buy one from the first batch back in September when they were sporting Cherry MX Clear switches. As soon as I heard that a new batch was released (this time with Green switches and O-rings) I anticipated buying one, and apparently got one of the last this time around; as soon as I checked out, they were marked "sold out".

I waited anxiously for about a week and change and alas - it arrived today! I haven't spent much time playing with it but I want to get out my first impressions.

The CODE comes in a really nice box. It sounds like a lame thing to note, but I am *hugely* into packaging design and you can tell that they stood true to their desire to be minimal.

The keyboard's frame is amazingly solid and sturdy. It's well designed and again, minimal. Before you even pick it up you can feel the weight and quality in design. The key switches are mounted on a **steel backplate** giving it a nice weight (2.42lbs or about 1.1kg).

I think it's worth noting that I am relatively new to mechanical keyboards (owning them at least) and after years of flimsy, lightweight, crappy plastic - the inertia of the CODE is highly welcomed.

The shape of the frame is simple, but also slightly *brutalist*. It's a glimpse into the future with a hint of the 80s' "we're not fucking around" attitude. It almost reminds me of an IBM model M, but without the archaic feel.

The keys on the CODE are *really* pretty. They used a Helvetica font, which I can't argue with (*who doesn't like Helvetica?*), and are beautifully backlit (optionally of course) by white LEDs (which have 7 different brightness settings). One thing I noticed that I don't think I've seen noted anywhere else, something I ***really*** like, is the attention to detail in the positioning of the letters. It wasn't apparent at first, but all of the keys with alternate characters (ie: the numrow) have their symbols **adjacent to their respective characters instead of awkwardly floating above them**. I don't know what it is about this but it *just feels right*. Balanced. Symmetric.

*oh right, typing:*

The Cherry MX Greens in the CODE are far less stiff than I expected. Again, I'm not a pro (or anything near one) at mechanical keyboards, but numerically, the Greens have a far higher actuation force than almost every other Cherry keyswitch at 80cN of force. (the Clears are 55cN I believe). That said, I fell in love with them almost immediately. I've only been typing on them for a few hours, but I have no problems so far and it's just as fun and comfortable as I had expected.

One thing I am not entirely sure I like, however, are the preinstalled O rings. They're very convenient for noise dampening and cushioning your keys when you bottom out, but they are slightly mushy feeling and hard to get used to. I may remove them, I may not. (I did remove one only from the backspace key, as it just felt too awkward on the one finger I stretch out to press it).

In the box there is **a wire keycap puller** (which is awesome because I love customization), **a PS/2 adapter** (for obligatory 1990s support), and **a 70.8‚Äù micro USB cable**. That last one braches off of a cool feature of the CODE: it interfaces over a removable micro USB cable so you don't have to worry about breaking your cable, awkward travel cable management, or length. You can use whatever cable  you want.

There are a bunch of other cool features worth noting such as the ability to use any a cool groove for routing said cable in any direction, cleverly placed media keys, rubber flip-out feet, and a DIP switch that makes the functionality hugely configurable (6 boolean settings giving you 64 different confugurations). This includes control of:

  - OSX support
  - Dvorak / Colmak
  - Disabling the OS key
  - Remapping caps-lock as a control key
  - Remapping scroll lock as an OS key
  - Remapping the menu (right click) key as an Fn key
  
All incredibly useful features.

All around, my first impression of the CODE was very good. The past few hours of using it have been extremely enjoyable and the prospect of using this thing for years to come is a nice one, whether it's for code, writing (heh, I hope), or gaming.
