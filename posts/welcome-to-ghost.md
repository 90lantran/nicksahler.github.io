Hiya! To everyone who actually gave my blog some attention, I'd like to apologize! If you're reading this, it's probably obvious that this blog is no longer hosted on tumblr. It's now hosted on [Ghost](http://ghost.org): an awesome blogging platform written in Node.

Now that that's out of the way; what I intend on doing about not posting for a while. I have a few posts saved as drafts pending revision and confidence to post that I'll get to very soon, including my ... uh... non-monthly crowdfunding projects. (heh... yeah...) and some information on projects I've been working on. Stay tuned!
