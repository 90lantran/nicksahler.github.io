Hi! I'm Nick. I was born in 1994 and I’m presently 20 years old. I’m from New Jersey, from a tiny town right next to Princeton. This is what I look like:

*I am a reductionist utilitarian autodidact to the effect of minimalism.*  
Meaning that I am relatively materialistic, but like to keep it to a minimum, love Ockham’s razor, hate waste, and am primarily self taught.

*I am intrinsically motivated.*  
Meaning that I am not motivated purely by traditional, extrinsic reward (money, status, etc); instead, I am motivated by autonomy, mastery and purpose. That said; I still like money. I am just not *entirely* motivated to do complex things and things I am passionate about, by money.

I am currently working on a plethora of projects which you can find throughout my site. A directory of my work can be found [here](/#/portfolio).
