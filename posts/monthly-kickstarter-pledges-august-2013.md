From here on out I am going to back (I hope) two Kickstarter projects every month, and write a tiny bit about why I did so and why I like the projects. I did three this month, but can't promise that many every month for a few reasons.

## Field &amp; Crew's Heritage Watch

Okay, maybe I lied. I backed this one in July, but I'm counting it for this month to get it out there. I backed Field &amp; Crew for a few reasons, the main reason being I simply wanted it to exist (this happens quite often for me, and will continue to). I went with the $5 reward because I was not really in the market for a watch, and because I was not really ready to spend a whole lot on one either. On top of that, the watches themselves are gorgeous, and offer lots of customization. They have the whole rustic feel, which is something I am into, and they are made in America, which is another thing I am heavily into. All together, I put in my $5 with hopes that one day in the future I could still be able to buy something from them, assuming that their kickstarter was a success (which it was!).

## Visionnaire Fine Writing Instruments

If you didn't notice, I _really_ like physical and mechanical things. Despite being a computer science nerd and a tech enthusiast, I often like material goods that **don't **have circuitry in them. Y'know. General shiney things. This _kinda_ plays to the rustic tone as well, but I guess that's most of kickstarter (hipsters!). I backed their $45 deal for the noir pen, and am anxious to get it (estimated to be October). I am not by any means a calligraphy enthusiast (although I would like to be!), but I do love cursive, and writing with nice things. The pen is a sword, it should be well crafted, and feel good to use (I feel similarly about the keyboard...).

## OFF pocket

I backed this one for the sake of it existing as well ($10). I like the idea, and I love the concept of people having control of their privacy, even though I myself am extremely lenient with my own privacy, and leave most things very open. I won't ever likely buy one of these or use one, as I like having my phone both on and actively transmitting (I'll post more about this later), but I certainly would like the world to have the option of shutting everything down physically. It's their choice, not ISP's or the government's.
