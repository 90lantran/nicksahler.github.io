This is a constantly growing and not entirely up to date collection of things I've worked on. If you want more details on any specific project, just e-mail me!

A lot of the works are stored in images because they are either changed, or are hosted on servers that are not always up (ex: personal servers). I will try my best to provide links to the actual web-viewable content, but won't always be able to.

- Code I work on publicly could be found on my [github](http://github.com/nicksahler) account.
- You can find some of my web development and design work on [my behance profile](https://www.behance.net/nicksahler)
- My work experience is typically listed on [my resume](http://nick.sahler.co/resume), although I can't promise that it will always be up to date.
- Digital art and photography is usually posted to my [deviantart](http://nicksahler.deviantart.com) account.
